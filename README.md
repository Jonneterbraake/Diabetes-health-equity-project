#  Danish, Australia, Netherlands, Scotland Diabetes Health Equity Project 

# Introduction
This repository contains the data and code used in the Danish, Australia, Netherlands, Scotland Diabetes Health Equity Project, where we compared all-cause mortality trends by SES among adults with and without diabetes for 2004-2021 among four high income countries.
Further information regarding data sources and methodology can be found in the paper (link will be inserted). 

# Data
For this project, we used aggregated data containing counts of deaths and person-years (Danish and Dutch population and Australian and Scottisch diabetes populations) or population sizes (at 30 June of the given year, for Australian and Scottish general population) of follow-up in 5-year age groups, by sex, socioeconomic status, diabetes status, and calendar year.

For this project, we calculated Age-Standardised Mortality Rates and used a Poisson model to estimate the Slope Index of Inequality (SII), Relative Index of Inequality (RII), and changes in the SII and RII over time. The R-code we have used to conduct these analyses can be found on this page.
